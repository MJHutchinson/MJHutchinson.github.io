In order to control the spread of the epidemic and prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed, US states have implemented a suite of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including “stay-at-home” orders, bans on gatherings, and business and school closures. We model the epidemics in the US at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework. For each state, we estimate the time-varying reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person), the number of individuals that have been infected and the number of individuals that are currently infectious. We use changes in mobility as a proxy for the impact that NPIs and other behaviour changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We project the impact of future increases in mobility, assuming that the relationship between mobility and disease transmission remains constant. We do not address the potential effect of additional behavioural changes or interventions, such as increased mask-wearing or testing and tracing strategies. Nationally, our estimates show that the percentage of individuals that have been infected is 4.1% [3.7%-4.5%], with wide variation between states. For all states, even for the worst affected states, we estimate that less than a quarter of the population has been infected; in New York, for example, we estimate that 16.6% [12.8%-21.6%] of individuals have been infected to date. Our attack rates for New York are in line with those from recent serological studies [1] broadly supporting our modelling choices. There is variation in the initial reproduction number, which is likely due to a range of factors; we find a strong association between the initial reproduction number with both population density (measured at the state level) and the chronological date when 10 cumulative deaths occurred (a crude estimate of the date of locally sustained transmission). Our estimates suggest that the epidemic is not under control in much of the US: as of 17 May 2020, the reproduction number is above the critical threshold (1.0) in 24 [95% CI: 20-30] states. Higher reproduction numbers are geographically clustered in the South and Midwest, where epidemics are still developing, while we estimate lower reproduction numbers in states that have already suffered high COVID-19 mortality (such as the Northeast). These estimates suggest that caution must be taken in loosening current restrictions if effective additional measures are not put in place. We predict that increased mobility following relaxation of social distancing will lead to resurgence of transmission, keeping all else constant. We predict that deaths over the next two-month period could exceed current cumulative deaths by greater than two-fold, if the relationship between mobility and transmission remains unchanged. Our results suggest that factors modulating transmission such as rapid testing, contact tracing and behavioural precautions are crucial to offset the rise of transmission associated with loosening of social distancing. Overall, we show that while all US states have substantially reduced their reproduction numbers, we find no evidence that any state is approaching herd immunity or that its epidemic is close to over.","tags":null,"title":"Report 23: State-level tracking of COVID-19 in the United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas A Mellan","Henrique H Hoeltgebaum","Swapnil Mishra","Charlie Whittaker","Ricardo P  Schnekenberg","Axel Gandy","H Juliette T Unwin","Michaela A C Vollmer","Helen Coupland","Iwona Hawryluk","Nuno Rodrigues Faria","Juan Vesga","Harrison Zhu","**Michael Hutchinson**","others_(truncated for brevity)_"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588896000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588896000,"objectID":"51cf00c3bd78017186e4e84b097a56ed","permalink":"https://mjhutchinson.github.io/publication/mellan-2020-report/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T17:23:59.119037Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mellan-2020-report/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Vollmer","S Mishra","H Unwin","A Gandy","T Melan","V Bradley","H Zhu","H Coupland","I Hawryluk","**Michael Hutchinson**","others_(truncated for brevity)_"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588550400,"objectID":"9e2e067f7497e07a57184bd6995db73c","permalink":"https://mjhutchinson.github.io/publication/vollmer-2020-report/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T17:07:01.05408Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vollmer-2020-report/","section":"publication","summary":"Italy was the first European country to experience sustained local transmission of COVID-19. As of 1st May 2020, the Italian health authorities reported 28,238 deaths nationally. To control the epidemic, the Italian government implemented a suite of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including school and university closures, social distancing and full lockdown involving banning of public gatherings and non essential movement. In this report, we model the effect of NPIs on transmission using data on average mobility. We estimate that the average reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) is currently below one for all Italian regions, and significantly so for the majority of the regions. Despite the large number of deaths, the proportion of population that has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 (the attack rate) is far from the herd immunity threshold in all Italian regions, with the highest attack rate observed in Lombardy (13.18% [10.66%-16.70%]). Italy is set to relax the currently implemented NPIs from 4th May 2020. Given the control achieved by NPIs, we consider three scenarios for the next 8 weeks: a scenario in which mobility remains the same as during the lockdown, a scenario in which mobility returns to pre-lockdown levels by 20%, and a scenario in which mobility returns to pre-lockdown levels by 40%. The scenarios explored assume that mobility is scaled evenly across all dimensions, that behaviour stays the same as before NPIs were implemented, that no pharmaceutical interventions are introduced, and it does not include transmission reduction from contact tracing, testing and the isolation of confirmed or suspected cases. Some of these factors, such as contact tracing, are likely to be introduced and will contribute to reductions in transmission; therefore our estimates should be viewed as pessimistic projections. We find that, in the absence of additional interventions, even a 20% return to pre-lockdown mobility could lead to a resurgence in the number of deaths far greater than experienced in the current wave in several regions. Future increases in the number of deaths will lag behind the increase in transmission intensity and so a second wave will not be immediately apparent from just monitoring of the daily number of deaths. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as mobility should be closely monitored in the next weeks and months. To compensate for the increase in mobility that will occur due to the relaxation of the currently implemented NPIs, adherence to the recommended social distancing measures alongside enhanced community surveillance including swab testing, contact tracing and the early isolation of infections are of paramount importance to reduce the risk of resurgence in transmission.

However, most modern techniques are not well suited to handle a number of difficult situations. A recent piece of work we did aims to combine approaches for tackling three of these.\nSituations where we would like uncertainty estimates in our predictions For tasks such as classifying each photo in you photo library into a number of categories, or tagging them each as a particular person, the downsides to getting the decision wrong are minimal, if annoying for the end user. There are many other settings where the downsides to making the incorrect choice could mean life or death, such as medical applications, or driverless cars.\nIn these situations, we would like to know exactly how confident our model is in its predictions or decisions, so that downstream systems can account for this when taking action. For example when a driverless car is planning how to turn right, we\u0026rsquo;d very much like to know if it\u0026rsquo;s 99% sure that nothing is in its way, or if its a 50\u0026frasl;50 toss up between that and a small child.\nThis kind of problem can be solved with a more principled application of statistics to Machine Learning. When applied to deep learning this is often refereed to as Bayesian Deep Learning.\nThere exists a large body of literature in this area. In this project we focused on Variational Inference (VI) techniques.1\nSituations where the data we wish to learn from isn\u0026rsquo;t in one place It is easy to imagine that for a number of reasons, the data we want our model to learn from cannot be bought to a single locations. Examples may include legal reasons (e.g. the recent GDPR in Europe), or practical reasons (such as mobile phone/edge device data, or data that is too large to be efficiently transported).\nIn these situations, we would still like to be able to learn from this data, but many techniques cannot naively handle this. This area of work again has a large body of work, and is know as Distributed or Federated Learning.\nSituations where the data we are handling is privacy-sensitive Much of the data that we would like to use to train Machine Learning models is sensitive to someone in some way. This could be medical data, browsing history, or financial data. Data sources (i.e. the individuals from whom this data is collected) are rightly skeptical about handing over their information to third parities.\nRecent work showed that deep learning models have a tendency to memorise their input data, and using targeted attacks some input data can be recovered from them.2 In this case, the threat to a users sensitive data comes not just from people to whom they hand their data, but from anyone who has access to the models trained on their data.\nDifferential Privacy3 is the current gold standard in protecting the privacy of data while extracting information from it. By carefully processing updates, and in particular by adding noise, we can achieve a series of guarantees regarding information leakage, user utility loss, and more.\nDiffernetial Private Federated Variational Inference Our recent work builds on the Partition Variational Inference4 framework, a Variational Inference framework that allows for easy distributed and continual learning, and extends this to include privacy preserving updates based on recent differential privacy literature.

Furthermore, each client's data, computational resources and communication constraints may be very different. This setting is known as federated learning, in which privacy is a key concern. Differential privacy is commonly used to provide mathematical privacy guarantees. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to consider federated, differentially private, Bayesian learning. We build on Partitioned Variational Inference (PVI) which was recently developed to support approximate Bayesian inference in the federated setting. We modify the client-side optimisation of PVI to provide an ($backslashepsilon$, $backslashdelta$)-DP guarantee. We show that it is possible to learn moderately private logistic regression models in the federated setting that achieve similar performance to models trained non-privately on centralised data.","tags":null,"title":"Differentially Private Federated Variational Inference","type":"publication"}]
